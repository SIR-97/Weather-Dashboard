# Weather-Dashboard

For this challenge I utilised skills from the bootcamp about server APIs. This task was to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTMLand CSS. The application retrieves weather data for different cities from the following API application: https://openweathermap.org/forecast5 

My application generates a weather dashboard that allows for the input of a city.

When the user searches for a city they are presented with current and predicted future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history if searched again.

When the user views the current weather conditions for that city they are presented with: The city name, the date,An icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed

When the user views future predicited weather conditions for that city they are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays:The date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature and the humidity

[Note: js and css scripts are found within the assets folder]
